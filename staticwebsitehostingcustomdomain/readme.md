I completed a simple static website hosting into a custom domain. The detailed steps are in the reference. I am going to write down the steps from my memory below:

1. I created a new domain - basically purchased one - it involved buying a domain as well as the hosted zone. The combined cost was $ 14.50.
Will add the other steps later
